# Damalerio-Nikko_LW2A_Plant_Species_Image_Classification

## A. Project Overview

### ● Brief Description of the Project

This project involves building an image classification model using a collection of unique tree and plant species. All images were gathered manually and organized into folders to create a clean dataset. The model is trained using Teachable Machine to identify and distinguish between the different plant types.  

The main goal is to explore how machine learning models interpret visual data, how they learn to differentiate species, and how dataset quality impacts classification performance.

### ● Purpose of the Image Classification Model

The purpose of this model is:

- To accurately classify a variety of tree and plant species from images  
- To study how AI recognizes visual features and patterns  
- To gain hands-on experience in preparing datasets, training models, and evaluating predictions using Teachable Machine
